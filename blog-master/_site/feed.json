Mean -&gt; 0 and Standard deviation -&gt; 1  pdf  Standard Scores (z scores / z values)  Value on the z distribution that represents the number of standard deviations we are above or below the mean.  z = 1 -&gt; value is 1 sd above from mean, z = -1 -&gt; value is 1 sd below the mean.Changing from X units to Z units2 Step process:  Subtract the mean, to get the normal distribution centered at 0.  Divide by the standard deviation to normalize.  Steps for finding probabilities for a normal distribution :Step 1: Translate into P(x&lt;a), P(x&gt;b) or P(a&lt;x&lt;b)Step 2: Transform a, b into z values and lookup the value on the z table.Step 3: If P(x&lt;a) : use the value directly.\t\t\t If P(x&gt;a) : use 1 - z value.​\t\t\t If P(a&lt;x&lt;b): find the z value for b and a.
