Continuous : They are the ones which have uncountably infinite number of values - so many that we can’t even think about counting them.For example, measuring the speed of the neutrons in the large hadron collider after a collision experiment or national 8th standard maths average of a country.      Cumulative distribution function (cdf)  Sum of all probabilities for X that are equal to or less than a (value)      Expected Value and Variance    Expected value: long-term average value after repeating an experiment theoretically infinite number of times.          How to calculate:                  Multiply the value of x by its probability for all X          Sum the results.                      Variance: expected amount of variability in our results after repeating an experiment infinite number of times.          How to calculate:                  Subtract E(x) from x, and square, then multiply by the probability.          Sum the results.                    Binomial Distribution      involves only two outcome (yes, no) or (success, failure) or (0, 1)        Checking conditions:          Fixed number of trials      Classify the outcome into only two groups      Probability of success is same for each trial      Independent trials            pmf =     here, n is the fixed number of trials.    x is the specified number of successes.    p is the probability of success of any given trial        cdf = sum the pmf untill x or use the binomial table  ",
