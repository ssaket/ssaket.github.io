### Probability 201 (Distributions, Expected Value and more)

There are two common types of random variable:

1. Discrete random variable : They are the ones which have finite values and can also take countable infinite number of values. For example, X may be the total number of time heads turn up when we toss a fair coin 100times or total number of times we call our best friend in a month.
2. Continuous random variable: They are the ones which have uncountably infinite number of values - so many that we can't even think about counting them. For example, measuring the speed of the neutrons in the large hadron collider after a collision experiment or national 8<sup>th</sup> standard maths average of a nation.

#### Using Probability distribution:

For discrete random variables, we use probability mass function (pmf) that assigns probability to each value of X. For example, when rolling a dice we can
